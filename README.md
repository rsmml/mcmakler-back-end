# Install App Locally
[â†‘ Go To Top â†‘](https://github.com/rsmml/mcmakler-back-end//blob/master/README.md#readme)

**[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/rsmml/mcmakler-back-end/)**

- You can download the app with the following link:
  - [Get App Here](https://github.com/rsmml/mcmakler-back-end//archive/master.zip)

  - Unzip file.
  - Open Terminal.
  - Change Directory to the project folder **spectrm-challenge-master**

### Install App:

This project is built in
  ```ruby
  ruby '2.6.5'
  ```

  * In order to check the ruby version installed in your machine run:
    ```ruby
    ruby -v
    ```

  If you are running another version of Ruby, we can easily change it with **rbenv**

  **rbenv Instalation:**

  on the command line run:

  (Install **[BREW](https://brew.sh/)**, if you don't have it.)

  ```ruby
  brew install rbenv
  ```

  to check if it worked run:

  ```ruby
  rbenv --version
  ```

  **Install Ruby**

  Once rbenv is installed we have to install the Ruby version to be able to run
  this app localy. Run on the terminal:

  To check Ruby versions available:
  ```ruby
  rbenv install --list
  ```

  Install Ruby 2.6.5:
  ```ruby
  rbenv install 2.6.5
  ```
  ```ruby
  rbenv global 2.6.5
  ```

  And voilÃ¡ :confetti_ball: the ruby version we need is installed. You
  can go back to your preferred Ruby version by doing
  ```ruby
  rbenv install RUBY_VERSION
  ```
  ```ruby
  rbenv global RUBY_VERSION
  ```

* Make sure you are using the desired Ruby version to install.
  ```ruby
  ruby --version
  ```

* To see if you already have Bundler installed
  ```ruby
  bundler --version
  ```
  or
  ```ruby
  bundle --version
  ```

* This will install the bundler gem in Ruby 2.6.5
  ```ruby
  gem install bundler
  ```


* Don't forget to run
  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

If this doesn't work, you might need to install another tools or software
that some of the gems require. Follow the messages and install them.
Run **bundle** until everything is OK !


* **Set up Database**

The following command will create databases based on database.yml ,
load schema.rb, and seed the data by running seeds.rb.

```ruby
  rails db:setup
```

Run ```bundle install``` & ```rails db:migrate``` in case there are pending migrations. But I believe
it won't be necesary.


You don't have PostgreSQL, no problem:

```ruby
brew install postgresql
```

You can always check before with **postgres -V** if it is installed or not.
Then run:

```ruby
brew services start postgresql
```

* Once everything is Ok! you should be able to start the server.

Run now ```rails s``` and by default, the
server for the API will be hosted on ```http://localhost:3000```

It shold be running in ```localhost:3000``` to be able to fetch and send data
from Postman. Run

```ruby
rails s --p 3000
```
in case the default port is not 3000.

Yeey :tada: now it's time to install the front-end app:

## Instalation Fron-End App:

** cd to the directory smart-links-front-end **
```ruby
cd smart-links-front-end
```
Assuming that **Vue** and **vue-cli** are installed in your machine run:
```ruby
yarn install
```
If not:
```javascript
npm install vue
```
```javascript
yarn global add @vue/cli
```
and then run
```ruby
yarn install
```
To run the app:
```ruby
yarn dev
```
This should be running in
```ruby
http://localhost:8080
```

# BACK END:
[â†‘ Go To Top â†‘](https://github.com/rsmml/mcmakler-back-end//blob/master/README.md#readme)

- Create of a new rails API app, with postgreSQL for DB.

  ```ruby
  rails new mcmakler-back-end --database postgresql
  ```

- **User**

  I create a ```sessions``` controller and ```registrations``` controller for the
  sign-in and sing-up functions. This controllers will also store the id of the user
  logged_in in the ```Sessions``` that then will be applyed to the ```@current_user```
  created on the ```concerns```.

- **Properties**

  A ```Property``` model was created, linked to the ```User``` model, so only users
  registered will add apartments to the DB. The model has some somple validations.

  The ```properties controller```, which is placed on the ```/api/v1/``` directory
  has the basic CRUD actions that will return a JSON.


- **Get USER in order to log-in**

  Because when you install the APP there is no DB we have to create one and run the seed.rb file
  that will create 50 new messages with unknowns id.
  In order to know one of the identifiers, we will take the last instances of Message created, and from it, we will
  take the id or identifier.

  On the console run:

  ```ruby
  rails c
  ```
  Once the irb console is open, run

  ```ruby
  User.last.email
  ```
  You should get a string value like this: "user@user.com"
  This is the user e-mail for the log-in, its password is: ```123123```
  Keep it secret ðŸ¤«:no_mouth:


# FRONT END:
[â†‘ Go To Top â†‘](https://github.com/rsmml/mcmakler-back-end//blob/master/README.md#readme)

Even though I have knowleadge on React, I decided to use Vue.js to create this front-end app
due to that I was working with it more latelly and I feel more confortable with that.

This app uses ```vue-axios``` in order to comunicate with the DB of the API.
I used the strategy to store the User id that comes from the API on the localStorage
in order to get it at the moment to do the ```POST``` request that will connect the user
with the ```Property``` created.

# Docker
[â†‘ Go To Top â†‘](https://github.com/rsmml/mcmakler-back-end//blob/master/README.md#readme)

Once you have the project folder, 'cd' to the directory of the **spectrm-challenge** and run the following commands:

```ruby
docker-compose up
```
This will run the docker-compose.yml file, that will build the App. If there's an error, please run


```ruby
docker-compose down
```
```ruby
docker-compose build
```
(If theres a FATAL error from PostgreSQL, run ```brew services stop posgres```, and start again the container)

One last time, run again ```docker-compose up```

This should be fine :ok_hand: Now the app is running in **localhost:3000**

Now we should migrate our DB with:

```ruby
docker-compose run web rails db:migrate
```
```ruby
docker-compose run web rails db:seed
```

Done! Now to check that everything works, go to:

[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/api/v1/messages)


# Testing App
[â†‘ Go To Top â†‘](https://github.com/rsmml/mcmakler-back-end//blob/master/README.md#readme)

I created a series of test to verify that all messages created are done under the right
conditions.

**How to test app:**
On the terminal (in the directory of the project) run:
- Locally
```ruby
rspec
```

- Docker:

```ruby
docker-compose run web rspec
```

You should be able to see 2 types of tests. The first one, **Messages API** will verify
all the basic CRUD actions.
- Creating 10 messages and GET all of them with a :success status.
- Creating 1 message and GET it with a :success status.
- Creating 1 message with a POST request.
- Updating 1 message, first Created with a POST request, then updating the same
message with a PATCH request
- And finally, deleting 1 message, first Created with a POST request, then deleted that
same message with a DELETE request.

In the second part **Check Validations**, all validations are tested:
- A Message instance is created where its UUID should match a REGEX for UUIDs
- A Message instance is created with different types of characters from all types of languages
- A Message instance is created with a HTML Tag on its body. It checks that the validation error match with the validation of the model.
- A Message instance is created with more that 255 characters. It checks that the validation error match with the validation of the model.
- A Message instance is created with an e-mail and a link and it gets a 200 status.
- A Message instance is created. Then we GET that message and check that is hast a counter not nil, and that its value is 1 due that it's the first time
that message is retrieved.
